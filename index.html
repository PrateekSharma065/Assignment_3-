<h3>Chicken</h3>

Heat another teaspoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, place chicken breasts in and cook until edges are opaque, about 10 minutes.
For the pastry, process flour and butter in a food processor until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add cream. Process until combined. Add egg. Process until mixture just comes together. Transfer to work surface. Knead until smooth. Shape one-third of the pastry into a rectangle. Shape remainder into a rectangle. Wrap both in plastic wrap. Chill in fridge for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add leek and cook for 5 minutes or until soft. Add flour and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture bubbles. Remove from heat. Gradually add stock, whisking until smooth. Return to heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture thickens. Remove from heat. Stir in chicken, sour cream and rosemary. Season with salt and white pepper. Set aside to cool.Preheat oven to 220°C/200°C fan forced. Place a baking tray on bottom shelf of oven. Roll out larger portion of pastry into a 3mm-thick rectangle.
